# WORKING WITH DICTIONARIES
# A dictionary is a Python collection of key value pairs.
# Each key is connected to a value and use can use a key to access the value
# associated with that key. A Key's value can be a number, a string, a list
# or even another dictionary.
# In Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces {} with a series of key value
# pairs inside the braces, as shown below:
dict_example = {'value 1': 1, 'value 2': 'two'}
print(f"value 1 in the dictionary is - {dict_example['value 1']}")
print(f"value 2 in the dictionary is - {dict_example['value 2']}")
# Within dictionaries the key is the first part before the colon, in the example
# above, the key is 'value 1' and 'value 2'. The value of the key-value pair
# is whatever follows after the colon.
# Whenever you call the key, the value will be used.
